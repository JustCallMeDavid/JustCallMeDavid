- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m David!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning, in particular neural networks. A problem with neural nets is that they often perform badly when evaluated on data they have not been trained on, so I also look into (adversarial) domain adaptation. Yes, I am a fan of adversarial training! Another one of my interests is federated learning. It basically allows models (read: neural nets) to be trainined in a privacy preserving manner over distrubted data sources.
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning about the state of the art in adversarial domain adaptation and federated learning. Also interested in combining the two areas.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me ...
